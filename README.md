# T1TeenFit Web Application
The web application is an exercise-focused platform to encourage T1D teenage users aged 13-17 to meet the NHS physical activity guidelines and educate and support teens to gain confidence and autonomy in incorporating exercise and healthy eating with T1D.

Taking advantage of these formative years, the application will serve as a toolkit to learn and build healthy habits that lay the foundation for successful T1D management in adulthood.

The application allows the teen user to track their activity, provides helpful informational material related to physical activity, and a journaling feature to record thoughts and feelings.

In addition, the application features a virtual avatar persona that acts as the application's personality and is responsible for providing feedback in response to various conditional statements. The avatar's purpose is to provide an element of coaching by supplying helpful information in response to the teen users' achievements and any difficulties that arise.
